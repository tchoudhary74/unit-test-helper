> for github MCP what should I install npx? 

⏺ For GitHub MCP, you have two main options:

  Option 1: Official GitHub MCP Server (Recommended)

  This is the official MCP server from the Model Context Protocol team. You run it with npx - no global install needed:

  claude mcp add github \
    -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here \
    -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github

  Option 2: For Enterprise GitHub

  If your company uses GitHub Enterprise, you'll also need to set the API URL:

  claude mcp add github \
    -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here \
    -e GITHUB_API_URL=https://github.yourcompany.com/api/v3 \
    -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github

  What You Need

  1. Node.js - You should already have this (since you use React/Jest)
  2. GitHub Personal Access Token - Generate one at:
    - Regular GitHub: Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
    - Enterprise: Your enterprise GitHub's equivalent page

  Token Permissions needed:
  - repo (full access to repositories)
  - read:org (if you want to access org-level data)

  What the GitHub MCP Gives You

  Once connected, Claude can:
  - Search repositories and code
  - Read file contents from repos
  - Create/read issues and PRs
  - List branches, commits
  - Create files and commits

  ---
  Quick question: Is your company using regular GitHub.com or a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise? That'll determine which command you need.

> can you create the MCP for github 

⏺ Before I build one, let me clarify:

  There's already an official GitHub MCP (@modelcontextprotocol/server-github) that's well-maintained and comprehensive. You just run it with npx - no coding needed.

  So my question is:

  Do you want me to:

  A) Help you set up the official one (recommended)
  - Battle-tested, maintained by MCP team
  - Just needs your token and one command
  - Works with Enterprise GitHub too

  B) Build a custom GitHub MCP from scratch
  - Good if you want specific features only
  - Learning experience (like we did with weather/jest)
  - More control over what tools are exposed

  C) Build a lightweight custom one for your specific workflow
  - Only the tools you actually use (e.g., just PRs and issues)
  - Simpler, easier to get security approval for
  - Can be tailored to your enterprise setup

  ---
  If you're thinking about security approval at your company, option C might actually be easier - a small, auditable Python file with just the endpoints you need is often easier to get approved than a large npm package.

  What's your preference?

> before that I used /compact when close the terminal how can I access the 
summary with you 

⏺ Good question - let me check the Claude Code documentation on this.

⏺ claude-code-guide(Check Claude Code summary access)
  ⎿  Done (9 tool uses · 41.8k tokens · 23s)                               

⏺ Here's what you need to know:

  Your Conversations Are Saved Automatically

  Claude Code saves all conversations locally. You don't lose them when you close the terminal.

  How to Access Previous Conversations

  # Continue your most recent conversation
  claude --continue

  # Or pick from a list of past conversations
  claude --resume

  When you use --resume, you'll see a picker showing:
  - Session summary
  - Time elapsed, message count
  - Git branch it was on

  About /compact Specifically

  The /compact command compresses the conversation to save context space, but the summary itself isn't saved as a separate file you can read. It's embedded in the session.

  When you resume a compacted session, you get the compacted version with the summary intact.

  Better Workflow for Your Situation

  Since you mentioned the 60-min timeout issue, here's what I'd recommend:

  # Before closing or timeout, export the conversation
  /export my-session-notes.md

  # Next day, resume where you left off
  claude --continue

  Or create a CLAUDE.md file in your project root - Claude reads this automatically and it persists key context between sessions.
